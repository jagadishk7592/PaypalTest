# employeeserv

## Application Overview
employeeserv is a spring boot rest application which would provide the CRUD operations for `Employee` resource.

There are three modules in this application
- employeeservApi - This module contains the interface.
	- `v1/schema/employee.json` defines the employee resource.
	- `jsonschema2pojo-maven-plugin` is being used to create `Employee POJO` from json file.
	- `EmployeeResource.java` is the interface for CRUD operations on `Employee` resource.
		- GET `/v1/bfs/employees/{id}` endpoint is defined to fetch the resource.
- employeeservImplementation - This module contains the implementation for the rest endpoints.
	- `EmployeeResourceImpl.java` implements the `EmployeeResource` interface.
- employeeservFunctionalTests - This module would have the functional tests.

## How to run the application
- Please have Maven version `3.3.3` & Java 8 on your system.
- Use command `mvn clean install` to build the project.
- Use command `mvn spring-boot:run` from `employeeservImplementation` folder to run the project.
- Use postman or curl to access `http://localhost:8080/v1/bfs/employees/1` GET endpoint. It will return an Employee resource.

## Assignment
We would like you to enhance the existing project and see you complete the following requirements:

- `employee.json` has only `name`, and `id` elements. Please add `date of birth` and `address` elements to the `Employee` resource. Address will have `line1`, `line2`, `city`, `state`, `country` and `zip_code` elements. `line2` is an optional element.
- Add one more operation in `EmployeeResource` to create an employee. `EmployeeResource` will have two operations, one to create, and another to retrieve the employee resource.
- Implement create and retrieve operations in `EmployeeResourceImpl.java`.
- Resource created using create endpoint should be retrieved using retrieve/get endpoint.
- Please add the unit tests to validate your implementation.
- Please use h2 in-memory database or any other in-memory database to persist the `Employee` resource. Dependency for h2 in-memory database is already added to the parent pom.
- Please make sure the validations are done for the requests.
- Response codes are as per rest guidelines.
- Error handling in case of failures.
- Idempotency logic is implemented to avoid duplicate resource creation.

## Assignment submission
Thank you very much for your time to take this test. Please upload this complete solution in Github and send us the link to `bfs-sor-interview@paypal.com`.

## Things implimented as part of assigment :
* Implemented H2-In memory Data base configurations with JPA.
* Implemented H2 console in app.props to check DB that weâ€™ve created.
* Created initial sql script file for creating tables and to inserted some mock data into required tables.
* Added address and date of birth fields in employee and generated it through json to object mapper.
* Made address object as foreign key in employee table and mapped together.
* Implemented dynamic GET API from scratch to retrieve employee resource from H2 in memory DB.
* Implemented dynamic POST API from scratch to save employee resource into Employee table in H2 in memory DB.
* Added proper error handling  mechanisms for both APIs with proper error/success messages and HTTP statuses in response object.
* Added proper validations in API response object and while mapping/saving data into H2.
* Created repository implementation class for DB operations. 
* Implemented test cases for both API resources in the same application as Junit dependencies are not accessible  in employeeServTestFunctions service,  but they all passed.
